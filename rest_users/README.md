Problem Statement
=================
The intent of the problem is to create a simple web service that allows all basic RESTful operations.

Requirements
============
1. Create a web service that allows to manipulate list of users.
2. Store all data in memory. There is no need to persist - so everything will be lost when server is restarted.
3. You are free to define input and output data structures and any endpoints that you will need.

Keep the Following In Mind
--------------------------
1. You have as much time as you need to finish. We understand people have busy lives and appreciate you taking the time to work on this.
2. The code does not need to be perfect, but it needs to be:
    - Properly organized and documented.
    - Runnable from the command line of a Unix-like system.
    - Demonstrate qualities of reliable and easy to maintain code.
3. Test cases are expected. We rely heavily on tests, so good tests are important to us.
4. You can use any programming language, though a JVM based language is preferred.
5. You can use open source libraries to parse and output data. We're not crazy - you're not expected to write a JSON parser.
6. Document how to run the program in a file named RUNME.txt
    - Assume a Unix-like OS such as Linux, BSD, or OS X
    - The exact commands used to build the program
    - The exact commands used to run unit tests
    - The exact commands used to execute the program
7. Be prepared to discuss your solution, choices, and tradeoffs.
