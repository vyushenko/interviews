Problem Statement
=================
The intent of the problem is to create a simple web service that allows all basic RESTful operations.

Requirements
============
1. Create a web service that allows to manipulate a list of users.
2. Please define input and output data structures and any endpoints that are needed.
3. Store all data in memory. There is no need to persist any data, and that means that everything will be lost when server is restarted.

Keep the Following In Mind
--------------------------
1. You have as much time as you need to finish. We understand people have busy lives and appreciate you taking the time to work on this.
2. The code does not need to be perfect, but it needs to be:
    - Properly organized and documented.
    - Runnable from the command line of a Unix-like system.
    - Demonstrate qualities of reliable and easy to maintain code.
3. Test cases are expected. We rely heavily on tests, so good tests are important to us.
4. You can use any programming language.
5. You can use open source libraries to parse and output data.
6. Document how to run the program in a file named RUNME.txt
7. Be prepared to discuss your solution, choices, and tradeoffs.
